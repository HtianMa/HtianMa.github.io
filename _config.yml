          A Pytorch framework to achieve tasks.

          This is a framework what you can implement some task you want by simply modifying or adding some codes. The basic framework of this is from [backdoors101](https://github.com/ebagdasa/backdoors101) and I make some modifies to achieve my goals.

          I deleted some specific codes based on the original framework so you can use it directly to complete the task, such as classification, object detection and so on.
